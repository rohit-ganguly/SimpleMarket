# SimpleMarket
A cross-platform mobile application written in Dart using the Flutter framework that provides a simple way of keeping up with finance, mainly the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and major Cryptocurrency market.

## What's going to happen here?
- I'm going to update progress of the application through several chapters which you can access below in Markdown, in order to show off the thought process taken when creating this app.

### Plan of Action
1. Explanation of application - goals, requirements, planned features, etc.
2. User Interface Design mockup + revision using Figma.io
3. Implementing User Interface using Flutter
4. Establishing back-end operations
5. Adding testing capabilities
6. + more soon
