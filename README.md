# SimpleMarket
A cross-platform mobile application written in Dart using the Flutter framework that provides a simple way of keeping up with finance, mainly the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and major Cryptocurrency market.

## What's going to happen here?
- I'm going to update progress of the application through several chapters which you can access below in order to show off the thought process taken when creating this app.

### Plan of Action
1. Explanation of application - goals, requirements, planned features, etc.
2. User Interface mockup + revision using Figma.io
3. Implementing User Interface using Flutter
4. Establishing back-end operations
5. Adding testing capabilities
6. + more soon

#### 1. Explanation of application - goals, requirements, planned features, etc.
- The goal of SimpleMarket is to create a *beginner-friendly* mobile application that allows those new to finance to view the stock/cryptocurrency market easily.

- The app itself will require a connection to an external API that updates real-time stock market data. For this app, the Financial Modeling Prep API will be used. Check it out here! https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs

- Planned Features:
  - The option to view a stock's performance for the current day, past week, past month, past 3 months, year, and then five years.
  - The ability to 'watch' a stock, and recieve push notifications for changes more than 3% in a day.
  - Pulling up important stock data, such as beta, quarterly earnings, and more.
  - A 'tutorial/lesson' feature where each value of the market is taken and explained in-depth
  - A tab on the app to view news of the stocks that they decide to put on their watch list.
  
#### 2. User Interface mockup + revision (coming soon!)
![Mockup 1](https://i.imgur.com/JijwQpY.png)
Here's the first mockup I put together.
Some thoughts:
- 3 tabs, 1 for news, 1 for lessons the user can watch on the stock market, and 1 for the market update itself.
- The color scheme is loosely based off of Robinhood, but more easy on the eyes.
- There's a logo in place, this will be the logo as I continue making the app.
- In the market page, there's going to be 2 tabs which can be switched between on the top underneath the logo. I'm also considering to add an invisible app bar with a settings icon to toggle certain features/color scheme (will update in future versions).
